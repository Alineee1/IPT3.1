            The oyster mushroom has its place in regional and international cuisine 
            as well as in natural medicine. <br>
            While it still got our ancestors through the winter months as a daily yield, <br>
            it has moved into the shadow of other cultivated mushrooms in Europe in recent decades.<br><br>
            In Asia, the easy-to-cultivate edible mushroom is valued for its umami flavor intensity. <br><br>
            In nature it is mainly found on dead wood, in cultivation it is satisfied with wood, paper, and straw.

                Cooking: <br>
                The oyster mushroom is a true delicacy. 
                The aroma reminds some of the veal, others of chicken. 
                In dishes, the oyster mushroom intensifies the flavor of the ingredients. 
                This is due to the abundant amount of glutamic acid, which acts as a free amino acid flavor enhancer.<br><br>

                Health: <br>
                It contains vitamin D, which supports the regeneration of bones and cartilage and can prevent 
                osteoporosis. One of these polysaccharides, beta-glucan pleuran, 
                is also responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of the oyster mushroom, 
                which can provide relief from intestinal inflammation, arthritis, prostatitis, 
                and autoimmune diseases, among others.<br><br>

                Beauty:<br>
                In recent years, the antioxidant effect of the mushroom has led to its marketing 
                as an anti-aging agent, where mainly mushroom extracts are used.<br><br>
