        <div class="h-m">
            Since ancient times, elder has been dedicated to Miss Holle, the earth goddess. <br>
            It represents a gateway to the underworld and according to old folk belief, 
            elder could keep away negative influences from outside, attract negativity from house, 
            yard and stable and drain it into the earth. <br><br>
            In addition, it was believed that elderberry could take away diseases from people through offerings that were placed under the bush. <br><br>
            It was also considered a protective shrub against evil spirits and demons. <br>
            In ancient England, morticians always carried some elder wood for protection, 
            and in America you can still find many cemeteries with elder bushes planted there to ward off evil spirits
